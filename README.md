# Fitness-Tracker-Analysis

## Purpose: 
### The goal of this project is to analyze FITBIT fitness data to discover opportunities for Bellabeat’s business. Specifically, I will analyze the consumer data to learn how consumers are using their devices, which will help guide Bellabeat’s marketing direction.

### The goals of my research aim to answer the following questions:

 * What are some trends in smart device usage?
 * How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
 * How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

### I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

### Deliverables:

 * A clear summary of the business task
 * A description of all data sources used
 * Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
 * A summary of your analysis
 * Supporting visualizations and key findings
 * Your top high-level content recommendations based on your analysis
