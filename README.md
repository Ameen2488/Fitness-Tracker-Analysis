## Purpose: 
### The goal of this project is to analyze FITBIT fitness data to discover opportunities for Bellabeat’s business. Specifically, I will observe smart device data to learn how consumers are using their devices, which will help guide Bellabeat’s marketing direction.

### The goals of my research aim to answer the following questions:
